# `composer-summary` Demo

So you have a composer.json.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "laravel/framework": "5.2.*"
  }
}
```

You want to start documenting why each dependency was added.

```bash
composer-summary ./composer.json ./composer.md
```

Gives you a `composer.md`.

```markdown
# Composer Dependencies

I'm generated by [composer-summary](https://github.com/oncarrot/composer-summary).

<!-- put whatever you want here -->

## `require`

### [`laravel/framework`](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework)

## `require-dev`

<!-- generated content -->
```

Let's add some helpful documentation so the poor soul that comes after us knows why we added this dependency.

It's super simple: **just edit the markdown file as you normally would**

```diff
--- a/demo/composer.md
+++ b/demo/composer.md
 
 ### [`laravel/framework`](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework)
 
+Not sure what this is but it seems important. See [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
+
 ## `require-dev`
 
```

That's it! Now let's add phpunit because we gotta have tests.

```diff
--- a/demo/composer.json
+++ b/demo/composer.json
 {
   "require": {
     "laravel/framework": "5.2.*"
+  },
+  "require-dev": {
+    "phpunit/phpunit": "~4.0"
   }
 }
```

Update your docs

```bash
composer-summary ./composer.json ./composer.md
```

```diff
--- a/demo/composer.md
+++ b/demo/composer.md
Not sure what this is but it seems important. See [Laravel](https://laravel.com/
 
 ## `require-dev`
 
-<!-- generated content -->
+### [`phpunit/phpunit`](https://packagist.org/packages/phpunit/phpunit)
 
```

Now go add some notes! You should end up with a nice little markdown file [like this](./simple.md). Yay!

A more complicated example is at [bedrock-composer.md](./bedrock-composer.md).
